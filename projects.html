                    including Qatargas and Gazprom. NAWRAS AL RAIDA was able to meet the requirements of many Asian and
                    European countries by supplying them with LNG, as it was able to supply the Chinese market with more
                    than 10 million tons of gas over a period of three years. As a leading LNG contractor, it has helped
                    clients succeed in projects by meeting their needs. It expects growing demand, mainly in Asia, for
                    LNG,
                    which places less burden on the environment and can be consumed in locations far from the production
                    site. In response to this increased demand, NAWRAS AL RAIDA plans for the exploitation of LNG
                    resources
                    in the Polar Regions that were previously considered too difficult to access, as well as the
                    development
                    of smaller gas fields are being explored. The company is striving to accumulate a variety of
                    technologies that can increase LNG extraction, such as the utilization of modular construction for
                    facilities, the installation of Hot Air Recirculation (HAR) prediction systems, and the practical
                    use of
                    FLNG.

                        environmental burden resulting from processing these ores. Securing non-ferrous metals, such as
                        copper, nickel, and rare metals, is growing in importance worldwide amid robust demand from
                        emerging countries. The company contributes to the expansion of non-ferrous metal supply by
